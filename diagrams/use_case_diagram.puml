note right of UC1
  **Deployment:**
  • Create K8s Pod
  • Load WASM runtime
  • Configure resources
end note

note right of UC2
  **Initialization:**
  • Load microROS core
  • Setup ROS2 DDS
  • Register nodes
end note

note right of UC11
  **Communication:**
  • Direct ROS2 DDS
  • No bridge needed
  • Native protocol
end note
