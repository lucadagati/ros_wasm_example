note right of RT1
  **Complete microROS stack**
  **runs inside WASM:**
  
  • No external bridge
  • Direct ROS2 DDS
  • Full isolation
  • Portable & secure
end note

note right of K8S
  **K8s provides:**
  
  • Orchestration
  • Scaling
  • Health checks
  • Service discovery
  • Updates & rollbacks
end note
